			<p>I am currently employed as a sound engineer in an extremely high-pressured environment, working on live, outside broadcast, radio events. This requires a lot of technical expertise, on the spot problem solving, high levels of concentration and the ability to keep calm under pressure. Within this period of employment and all the other positions that I have held I have been enrolled in health and safety courses and I currently hold an up-to-date safe pass. I have studied sound engineering and modern music in college and have always shown determination and a willingness to learn in whatever position that I have held. </p>
